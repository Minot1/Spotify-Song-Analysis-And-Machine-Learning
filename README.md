# Spotify-Song-Analysis-And-Machine-Learning

This is a data science and analysis project where I used a Kaggle Spotify dataset with over 160k songs.
*	Exploratory Data Analysis: I explored the data through visualization techniques like using histograms and heatmapping with the help of matplotlib library.
*	Statistical Analysis and Hypothesis Testing: I statistically tested a corelation with hypothesis testing.
*	Machine Learning: I designed a prediction algorithm for song popularity where I used Random Forest Regressor, AdaBoost Regressor, and Decision Tree Regressor.
